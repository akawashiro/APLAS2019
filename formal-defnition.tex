\section{Formal Definition of \LMD}

In this section, we give a formal definition of \LMD, including
the syntax, full reduction, and type system.  In addition to full reduction,
in which any redex at any stage can be reduced, we also give staged reduction,
which models execution as programs.

\subsection{Syntax}

\AI{Rename ``type variables'' to ``type-level constants''. }
We assume the denumerable set of type variables, ranged over by
metavariables \(X, Y, Z\), the denumerable set of variables, ranged
over by \(x,y,z\), the denumerable set of constants, ranged over by
\(c\), and the denumerable set of stage variables, ranged over by
\(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\).  The metavariables \(A, B, C\) range over
sequences of stage variables; we write \(\varepsilon\) for the empty
sequence.  \AI{I prefer $\varepsilon$ for the nonempty sequence.}  \LMD is defined by the following grammar:

\AI{``Transition'' is still used.}

\begin{align*}

\end{align*}

\AI{Add $M\,\alpha$ to terms.}

\AI{Is $O$ used as a metavariable?}
\AI{Domain and FV are not defined (yet).  I think we should introduce the notion of well-formed type environments by prose below and assume every type environment is well formed.}

% Description on meta variables


% Kinds

A kind, which is used to classify types, is either $*$, the kind of
proper types (types that terms inhabit), or $\Pi x\colon\tau.K$, the kind
of type operators that takes $x$ as an argument of type $\tau$ and returns a type
of kind $K$.
% Types
% of terms have kind $*$ and dependent types have $\Pi$-kinds.  For
% example, $\lambda x:\I.x$ has type $\Pi x:\I.\I$, which has $*$ kind.
% \red{この段落は短いので型の段落と結合するか?}
% Types
A type is a type variable $X$, which is declared in the signature with its kind, a dependent function type $\Pi x:\tau_1.\tau_2$,
an application of a type (operator) of $\Pi$-kind to a term, a code type $\TW_\alpha$, or an $\alpha$-closed type $\F\alpha.\tau$.
We sometimes abbreviate $\Pi x:\tau_1.\tau_2$ to $\tau_1 \rightarrow \tau_2$ if
$x$ is not a free variable in $\tau_2$. \AI{This should be mentioned after free variables are introduced.}
An application of a term to a dependent function type \AI{this sounds like $M\, (\Pi x:\tau_1.\tau_2)$} is, for example, $\text{Vector}\ 10$
if type variable $\text{Vector}$ has the kind $\Pi x:\I.*$.
A code type $\TW_\alpha \tau$ denotes a code fragment of a term of type $\tau$.
An $\alpha$-closed type corresponds to a runnable code fragment.
Type constructors tie strongly \AI{Is ``tie strongly'' standard?} in the order of 
an application of a term to a dependent function type $\tau\ M$,
a code type $\TW_{\alpha} \tau$,
a dependent function type $\Pi x:\tau.\tau$, 
an $\alpha$-closed type $\F\alpha.\tau$.
Therefore, $\F\alpha.\TW_{\alpha} \Pi x:\I.\text{Vector}\ 5$ is interpreted as
$\F\alpha.(\TW_{\alpha} (\Pi x:\I.(\text{Vector}\ 5)))$. \AI{I don't understand this rule...}

% Terms

Terms include ordinary (explicitly typed) \(\lambda\)-terms, constants,
whose type is declared in signature $\Sigma$, and the following five forms
related to multi-stage programming:
$\TB_\alpha M$ represents a code fragment; $\TB_\alpha M$ represents escape;
$\Lambda\alpha.M$ is a stage variable abstraction;
$M\ \epsilon$ is an application of $\epsilon$ to a stage variable \AI{I think the usage of ``application'' is wrong again}; and 
$\%_\alpha M$ is an operator for cross-stage persistence.
The prefix operators $\TB_\alpha, \TBL_\alpha$, and $\%_\alpha$ tie stronger than the two forms of applications
and applications are left-associative
and two abstractions extends as far to the right as possible.
For example, $\F\alpha.\lambda x:\I.\TB_\alpha x\ y$ means $\F\alpha.(\lambda x:\I.(\TB_\alpha x)\ y)$.

% Signature

We adopt a \LLF-like system, where constants and type variables for base types \AI{``for base types''?} are given in the signature $\Sigma$, which 
are a sequence of declarations of the form $c:\tau$ and $X:K$.
For example, when we use integers in \LMD, $\Sigma = \I :: *, 1:\I, 2:\I, \cdots$.  \AI{It sounds like we need an infinite signature...}
\AI{Change Int to Bool.}

% Free variables
As usual, the variable $x$ is bound in $\lambda x:\tau.M$
and the transition variable $\alpha$ is bound in $\Lambda \alpha.M$.
\AI{What about other binders such as $\Pi$?}
We identify $\alpha$-convertible terms and assume the names of bound variables are pairwise distinct.
We write $\FV(M)$ and $\FTV(M)$ for the set of free variables and the set of free stage variables in $M$, respectively.

% Contexts
Contexts \AI{Why not call them ``type environments'' to avoid confusion with evaluation contexts?} are sequences of triples of a variable, its type, and its stage.
$\textrm{Domain}$ is a function from a content to a set of variables defined in the context.
\AI{I'd prefer \textit{dom}.}
The side condition of $x\not\in\textrm{Domain}(\G)$ prevent multiple appearances of the same variable and
$x\not\in\textrm{FV}(\tau)$ is needed in the proof of Substitution Lemmas.

\AI{We should note that constants and type variables are not staged.}
\paragraph{Remark:}  \AI{Comparison with Hanada--Igarashi.}

\subsection{Reduction}

Next, we define full reduction for \LMD.
Before giving the definition of reduction, we define two kinds of substitutions.
Substitution $M[x\mapsto N]$ is the ordinary capture-avoiding substitution of
$N$ for $x$ in $M$, and we omit its definition here.
Substitution $M[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]$ of the empty stage
for stage variable $\alpha$ in $M$ is defined below.
\AI{What about $\tau[x \mapsto N], K[x \mapsto N], \tau [\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]$ and $K[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]$?}

\AI{Since we always substitute $\varepsilon$ for stage variables, we may want to introduce a special notation, something like $\textit{erase}_\alpha(M)$.}
\AI{We will use $[\alpha \mapsto \varepsilon]$ and $[\alpha \mapsto \beta]$.  The latter is renaming, so we can omit the definition.}

\begin{align*}
	% \newcommand{\SB}{}
	(\lambda x:\tau.M)[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon] & = \lambda x:(\tau[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]).(M[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon])                                  \\
	(M\ N)[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]             & = (M[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon])\ (N[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon])                                          \\
	(M\ \epsilon)[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]      & = (M[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon])\ \epsilon                                                                \\
	(\TB_\alpha M)[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]      & = M[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]                                                                          \\
	(\TB_\beta M)[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]      & = \TB_\beta (M[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon])                               & (\text{if } \alpha \neq \beta) \\
	(\TBL_\alpha M)[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]     & =  M[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]                                        &                               \\
	(\TBL_\beta M)[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]     & = \TBL_\beta (M[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon])                              & (\text{if } \alpha \neq \beta) \\
	(\Lambda\beta.M)[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]   & = \Lambda\beta.(M[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon])                            & (\text{if } \alpha \neq \beta) \\
	% (\Lambda\beta.M)[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]   & = \Lambda\beta.M                                                     & (\text{if } \alpha = \beta)    \\
	(\%_\alpha M)[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]       & = M[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]                                         &                                  \\
	(\%_\beta M)[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]       & = \%_{\beta[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]}(M[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon])      & (\text{if } \alpha \neq \beta) \\
\end{align*}

\begin{definition}[Reduction]
  \AI{It's not clear what are defined here.  You are talking only about rules.
    Something like ``The relations $M \longrightarrow_\beta N$, ... are the least compatible relations closed under the rules below.''}
	There are three reduction rules ($\longrightarrow_\beta, \longrightarrow_\blacklozenge, \longrightarrow_\Lambda$) in \LMD.
	Congruence rules which are omitted from the definition.
	\begin{align*}
		 & (\lambda x:\tau.M) N \longrightarrow_\beta M[x \mapsto N]                       \\
		% & (\Pi x:\tau.\sigma) M \longrightarrow_\gamma \sigma[x \mapsto M] \\
		 & \TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha M \longrightarrow_\blacklozenge M                        \\
		 & (\Lambda \alpha.M)\ \epsilon \longrightarrow_\Lambda M[\alpha \mapsto \epsilon]
	\end{align*}
	We write $ M \longrightarrow M'$ iff $ M \longrightarrow_\beta M'$, $ M \longrightarrow_\blacklozenge M'$, or $ M \longrightarrow_\Lambda M'$.
\end{definition}

The relation $\longrightarrow_\beta$ represents ordinary $\beta-$reduction in the \(\lambda\)-calculus; the relation 
$\longrightarrow_\blacklozenge$ represents that quotation $\TB_\alpha M$ is canceled by escape and $M$ is spliced into the code fragment surrounding the escape;
the relation $\longrightarrow_\Lambda$ means that a stage abstraction applied to the empty stage $\epsilon$ reduces to the body of abstraction
where $\epsilon$ is substituted for the stage variable.
Application of a non-$\epsilon$ stage to a stage abstraction is prohibited in order to simplify \LMD. \AI{This should have been mentioned earlier in the comparison with Hanada--Igarashi.}
There is no reduction rule for CSP as with Hanada and Igarashi \cite{Hanada2014}.
The CSP operator $\%_\alpha$ disappears when $\epsilon$ is substituted to $\alpha$.
% $\TB_\alpha$ and $\TBL_\alpha$ disappears in the same way as $\%_\alpha$.

\AI{A few examples are desirable.}

\subsection{Type System}

% 総論

In this section, we define the type system of \LMD.
% \LMD is little complicated because it contains dependent types.
It consists of six judgment forms for typing, kinding, well-formed kinding, term equivalence, type equivalence, and kind equivalence.
We list the judgments forms in Figure~\ref{fig:LMD-six-judgements}.
\AI{equality vs. equivalence?}
\AI{A few judgment forms do not match rules.}

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{align*}
			\G & \V M : \tau @ A   & \text{typing} \\
			\G & \V \tau :: K @ A  & \text{kinding} \\
			\G & \V K \iskind @ A  & \text{well-formed kinding} \\
			\G & \V M \E N @ A     & \text{term equality} \\
			\G & \V \tau \E \sigma & \text{type equality} \\
			\G & \V K \E J @ A     & \text{kind equality}
		\end{align*}
		\caption{Six judgment forms of the type system of \LMD.}
		\label{fig:LMD-six-judgements}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\AI{Insert a tilde (which is a space without a line break) between ``Figure'' and ref.}
\begin{definition}[Typing]
  The typing relation $ \G \V M : \tau @ A $ is the least relation closed under the rules in Figure~\ref{fig:typing-rules}.
  \AI{Precisely speaking, it cannot be defined independently of other judgments.
  How is dependency between judgments?}
\end{definition}

\AI{``judgment'' vs. ``judgement''.}  We start from defining typing of
\LMD.  Typing rules of \LMD are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:typing-rules}.  The rule \TConst{} means any constants in the
signature can appear at any stage.  \AI{This should be discussed
  earlier.}  For example, if we have a signature $\Sigma$ which is
$\textrm{bool} :: *, \textrm{true}: \textrm{bool}, \textrm{false}:
\textrm{bool}$, the derivation tree in
Figure~\ref{fig:tconst-derivation-tree} is admissible.  \AI{Don't we
  need signature well formedness?  If $c:\tau \in \Sigma$, then $\tau$
  should be a well-formed type under ... what?}  The rules \TVar,
\TAbs, and \TApp{} are almost the same as those in the simply typed
lambda calculus.  \AI{... or \(\lambda\)LF?  We are working in a dependently type system...}  Additional conditions are that subterms must be
typed at the same stage (\TAbs{} and \TApp); the type
annotation/declaration on a variable has to be a proper type of kind
$*$ (\TAbs) at the stage where it is declared (\TVar{} and \TAbs).

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{minipage}{0.50\hsize}
			\infer[\TConst]
			{\G \V \textrm{true}:\textrm{bool}@\alpha\beta}
			{\textrm{true}:\textrm{bool} \in \Sigma \andalso
				\ID{\G\V\textrm{bool}::*@\alpha\beta} \andalso
			}
			\caption{A derivation tree using \TConst}
			\label{fig:tconst-derivation-tree}
		\end{minipage}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


% \TConv
\AI{Looks like a paper is written for those who know multi-stage calculi fairly well but don't know dependent type systems.  The reality is opposite.}
As in standard dependent type systems, \TConv{} allows us to replace
the type of a term with an equivalent one.  
In a type system which includes dependent types, this kind of rule is essential
because two types which have different shapes may be equivalent.
For example, when we use a vector type with its size ($\textrm{Vector}\ n$),
$\textrm{Vector}\ 5$ is equivalent to $\textrm{Vector}\ (4+1)$ obviously although they are not equivalent in apparently.


% Typing rules for a multi-stage calculus
\AI{This paragraph is not very informaticve.  We shouldn't just refer redears to previous work.}
The rules \TTB, \TTBL, \TGen, \TIns, and \TCsp{} are rules for a multi-stage calculus.
They are corresponding to brackets, escape, making a stage abstraction, 
application of $\epsilon$ stage to a stage abstraction, and cross-stage persistence, respectively.
Please check Hanada and Igarashi \cite{Hanada2014} and Tsukada and Igarashi \cite{Tsukada} for details of these rules.

\subsubsection{Type and Term Equivalence}

As usual in dependent type systems, type equivalence, used in \TConv,
is important.  The type equivalence judgment of the form
$\G \V \tau \E \sigma : K @ A$ means that types $\tau$ and $\sigma$
are equivalent as types of kind $K$ at stage $A$ under $\G$.
Figure~\ref{fig:type-equivalence-rules} shows the rules for type
equivalence.  Type equivalence is basically the least congruence
closed under term equivalence.  The rules for compatibility (closure
under type formation) are derived from corresponding typing rules in a
straightforward manner.  The rules are a little simpler than some
dependent type systems \AI{such as?}  because there is no abstraction
at the type level.

% \QCsp以外の説明
% We show type equivalence rules in Figure \ref{fig:type-equivalence-rules}.
% All rules except \QTRefl, \QTSym, \QTTrans, and \QTApp\ are generated naturally from the typing rules.
% \QTRefl, \QTSym, \QTTrans\ exist in order to make the type equivalence relation an equivalence relationship.
% The rule \QTApp\ means that if there are two equivalent $\Pi$ type and two equivalent terms,
% the results of applications are also equivalent.

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\infrule[{\QTAbs }]{\G\V \tau \E \sigma :: *@A \andalso \G,x:\tau @A \V \rho \E \pi :: *@A}{\G\V\Pi x:\tau.\rho \E \Pi x:\sigma.\pi :: *@A} \\[2mm]

		\caption{Type Equivalence Rules.}
		\label{fig:type-equivalence-rules}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

The term equivalence judgment of the form $\G \V M \E N : \rho @ A$,
which means that terms $M$ and $N$ are equivalent as terms of type
$\rho$ at stage $A$ under $\G$, is defined by the rules in
Figure~\ref{fig:term-equivalence-rules}.  Most rules are
straightforward.  The rules \QAbs, \QApp, \QTB, \QTBL, \QGen, \QIns,
\QCsp, \QRefl, \QSym, and \QTrans{} make the relation congruence; the
rules \QBeta, \QTBLTB, and \QLambda{} correspond to the reduction rules.
\AI{Don't we give names to those reduction rules?}

% \QPercentの説明
The only rule that deserves elaboration is the last rule \QPercent.
Intuitively, it means that the CSP operator applied to term $M$ can be
removed if $M$ is also well typed at the next stage \(A\alpha\).
For example, constants do not depend on the stage (see \TConst) and
so \(\G\V \%_\alpha c \E c : \tau @ A\alpha\) holds but variables
do depend on stages and so this rule does not apply.

Interestingly, Hanada and Igarashi~\cite{} rejected the idea of
reduction to remove $\%_\alpha$ when they developed \LTP{}, as such
reduction does not match the operational behavior of the CSP operator
in implementation.  However, as an equational system for multi-stage
programs, the rule \QPercent makes sense and as we argue \AI{where?}
it is practically significant.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SKIP FROM HERE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$\text{mulmat}$ function in the following code fragment generate code for matrix multiplication.
$\text{mulmat}$ takes two integers which are the size of the multiplicand matrix and generate a code.
The last integer to decide the size of the multiplier matrix is given at runtime.
You can generate code by applying two integers to $\text{mulmat}$.
We applied 3 and 5 in the second line and got $\TW_\alpha \Pi z:\I.(\M\ z\ \%_\alpha 5) \to (\M\ \%_\alpha 5\ \%_\alpha 3) \to (\M\ z\ \%_\alpha 3)$.
But this type is difficult to combine with other code because there are two $\%_\alpha$ for CSP.
\QPercent\ states that we can erase this $\%_\alpha$ under a condition which is explained in the next paragraph.

The condition is that a CSPed value equals to the original value when it has the same type in the original stage.
For example, $\V \%_\alpha 5 \E 5 @ \alpha$ because $ \V 5 : \I @ \alpha $ from \TConst\ and  $ \V \%_\alpha 5 : \I @ \alpha$.
In other words, we can remove a $\%_\alpha$ symbol of a value when it doesn't change the type.

	% Example of QCsp (mulmat)
	{
		\begin{align*}
			\text{mulmat}       & : \Pi x:\I.\Pi y:\I.(\TW_\alpha \Pi z:\I.(\M\ z\ \%_\alpha y) \to (\M\ \%_\alpha y\ \%_\alpha x) \to (\M\ z\ \%_\alpha x)) \\
			\text{mulmat}\ 3\ 5 & : \TW_\alpha \Pi z:\I.(\M\ z\ \%_\alpha 5) \to (\M\ \%_\alpha 5\ \%_\alpha 3) \to (\M\ z\ \%_\alpha 3)                     \\
			                    & (\E \TW_\alpha \Pi z:\I.(\M\ z\ 5) \to (\M\ 5\ 3) \to (\M\ z\ 3) )                                                         \\
		\end{align*}
	}

This kind of type equality is very useful when we combine $\text{mulmat}\ 3\ 5$ with another code.
We cannot remove $\%_\alpha$ in the type without \QPercent and it makes very difficult to combine
because types of codes don't contain $\%_\alpha$ generally.

\subsubsection{Staged Semantics}

The reduction given above is full reduction and any redexes---even
under quotation---can be reduced in an arbitrary order.  Following
previous work~\cite{}, we introduce (small-step, call-by-value) staged
semantics, where only redexes at stage $\varepsilon$\AI{not quite true
  because of unquote--quote reduction} are reduced, modeling an
implementation.

We start with the definition of values.  Since terms under quotations are
not executed, the grammar is indexed by stages.

\begin{definition}[Values]
	The family $V^A$ of sets of values, ranged over by $v^A$,
	is defined by following grammar.  In the grammar, $A \neq \epsilon$ is assumed.
	\begin{align*}
		v^\epsilon \in V^\epsilon & ::= \lambda x:\tau.M \mid\ \TB_\alpha v^\alpha \mid \Lambda\alpha.v^\epsilon                                       & \\
		v^A \in V^A               & ::= x \mid \lambda x:\tau.v^A \mid v^A\ v^A \mid\ \TB_\alpha v^{A\alpha} \mid \Lambda\alpha.v^A \mid v^A\ \epsilon & \\
		                         & \quad\   \mid\ \TBL_\alpha v^{A'} (\text{if } A = A'\alpha \text{ for some } \alpha, A' \neq \epsilon)                          & \\
                                          & \quad\   \mid\ \%_\alpha v^{A'} (\text{if } A = A'\alpha  \text{ for some } \alpha, A')
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

Values at $\epsilon$ stage are a $\lambda$-abstraction, a quoted code,
or a $\Lambda$ abstraction.  The body of a $\lambda$-abstraction can
be any term but the body of $\Lambda$-abstraction has to a value.  It
means that the body of $\Lambda$-abstraction must be evaluated.  The
side condition for $\TBL_\alpha v^{A'}$ means that escapes in a value
can appear only under nested quotations (because an escape under a
single quotation will splice the code value into the surrounding
code).  See Hanada and Igarashi~\cite{} for details.

\begin{definition}[Evaluation Context and Redex]
  The family of sets $ECtx^A_B$ of evaluation contexts, ranged over by $E^A_B$,
the sets of $\epsilon$-redexes (ranged over by $R^\epsilon$) and $\alpha$-redexes (ranged over by $R^\alpha$) are defined by the following grammar.
	In the grammar, $A$ is assumed to be nonempty (but $B,A'$ can be empty).
	\begin{align*}
		E^\epsilon_B \in ECtx^\epsilon_B & ::= \square\ (\text{if\ } B = \epsilon) \mid E^\epsilon_B\ M \mid v^e\ E^\epsilon_B     
		\mid \TB_\alpha E^\alpha_B \mid \Lambda\alpha.E^\epsilon_B
		\mid E^\epsilon_B\ \epsilon                                                                                                 \\
		E^A_B \in ECtx^A_B               & ::= \square\ (\text{if } A = B) \mid \lambda x:\tau.E^A_B \mid E^A_B\ M \mid v^A\ E^A_B 
		\mid E^\epsilon_B \mid \TB_\alpha E^{A\alpha}_B
		\mid \TBL_\alpha E^{A'}_B \ (\text{where } A'\alpha = A)                                                                    \\
		                                 & \quad \mid \Lambda\alpha.E^\epsilon_B                                                   
		\mid E^A_B\ \epsilon \mid \%_\alpha\ E^{A'}_B \ (\text{where } A'\alpha = A)                                                \\
\\
		 R^\epsilon  & ::= (\lambda x:\tau.M)\ v^\epsilon \mid (\Lambda\alpha.v^\epsilon)\ \epsilon                                       & \\
		 R^\alpha    & ::=\ \TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha M                                                                                      & \\	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\AI{some more explanation of the syntax of evaluation contexts.}

We write $E^A_B[M]$ for the term obtained by filling the hole in $E^A_B$ by $M$
and define the staged reduction relation.

\begin{definition}[Staged Reduction]
	The staged reduction relation, written $M \longrightarrow_s M'$, is defined by 
	the least relation closed under the rules below.

			E^A_\epsilon [(\lambda x:\tau.M)\ v^\epsilon]       & \longrightarrow_s E^A_\epsilon[M[x\mapsto v^\epsilon]]             \\
			E^A_\epsilon [(\Lambda\alpha.v^\epsilon)\ \epsilon] & \longrightarrow_s E^A_\epsilon[v^\epsilon[\alpha\mapsto \epsilon]] \\
			E^A_\alpha [\TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha v^\alpha]        & \longrightarrow_s E^A_\alpha[v^\alpha]                             \\
