\section{Formal Definition of \LMD}

In this section, we give a formal definition of \LMD, including
the syntax, full reduction, and type system.  In addition to full reduction,
in which any redex at any stage can be reduced, we also give staged reduction,
which models execution as programs.

\subsection{Syntax}

We assume the denumerable set of \emph{type-level constants}, ranged over by
metavariables \(X, Y, Z\), the denumerable set of \emph{variables}, ranged
over by \(x,y,z\), the denumerable set of \emph{constants}, ranged over by
\(c\), and the denumerable set of \emph{stage variables}, ranged over by
\(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\).  The metavariables \(A, B, C\) range over
sequences of stage variables; we write \(\varepsilon\) for the empty
sequence. \LMD is defined by the following grammar:

% \AI{``Transition'' is still used.}

\begin{align*}
    % \textrm{Type variables}  &   &                          & X,Y,Z                                                                                                      \\

% Description of meta variables


% Kinds

A kind, which is used to classify types, is either $*$, the kind of
proper types (types that terms inhabit), or $\Pi x\colon\tau.K$, the kind
of type operators that takes $x$ as an argument of type $\tau$ and returns a type
of kind $K$.
% Types
% of terms have kind $*$ and dependent types have $\Pi$-kinds.  For
% example, $\lambda x:\I.x$ has type $\Pi x:\I.\I$, which has $*$ kind.
% \red{この段落は短いので型の段落と結合するか?}
% Types
A type is a type-level constant $X$, which is declared in the signature with its kind, a dependent function type $\Pi x:\tau_1.\tau_2$,
an application $\tau\ M$ of a type (operator) (of $\Pi$-kind) to a term, a code type $\TW_\alpha$, or an $\alpha$-closed type $\F\alpha.\tau$.
An application of a type (operator) of $\Pi$-kind to a term is, for example, $\text{Vector}\ 10$
if type-level constant $\text{Vector}$ has the kind $\Pi x:\I.*$.
A code type $\TW_\alpha \tau$ is for a code fragment of a term of type $\tau$.
An $\alpha$-closed type corresponds to a runnable code fragment.

% An application $\tau\ M$ of a type (operator) to a term connects tighter than
% $\TW_{\alpha}$ connects tighter than
% $\Pi$ in dependent types such as $\Pi x:\tau.\tau$ and $\Pi$ connect tighter than
% $\F$ in types for stage abstraction such as $\F\alpha.\tau$.
% Therefore, $\F\alpha.\TW_{\alpha} \Pi x:\I.\text{Vector}\ 5$ is interpreted as
% $\F\alpha.(\TW_{\alpha} (\Pi x:\I.(\text{Vector}\ 5)))$.
% \AI{I don't understand this rule...}

% Terms

Terms include ordinary (explicitly typed) \(\lambda\)-terms, constants,
whose type is declared in signature $\Sigma$, and the following five forms
related to multi-stage programming:
$\TB_\alpha M$ represents a code fragment; $\TB_\alpha M$ represents escape;
$\Lambda\alpha.M$ is a stage variable abstraction;
$M\ A$ is an application of stage $A$ to a stage abstraction; and
$\%_\alpha M$ is an operator for cross-stage persistence.

% Signature

We adopt the tradition of \LLF-like systems, where types of constants and kinds of type-level constants are globally declared in a signature $\Sigma$, which
is a sequence of declarations of the form $c:\tau$ and $X:K$.
For example, when we use Boolean in \LMD, $\Sigma$ includes $\B :: *, \textrm{true}:\B, \textrm{false}:\B$.
Type environments are sequences of triples of a variable, its type, and its stage.
We write \(\textit{dom}(\Sigma)\) and \(\textit{dom}(\Gamma)\)
for the set of (type-level) constants declared in \(\Sigma\) and \(\Gamma\), respectively.   As in other multi-stage calculi~\cite{Taha03,Tsukada,Hanada2014},
a variable declaration is associated with a stage
so that a variable can be referenced only at the declared stage.
Constants and type-level constants are not associated with stages;
so, we can use them at any stage.
We define well-formed signature and well-formed type environments later.

The variable $x$ is bound in $M$ of $\lambda x:\tau.M$ and in $\tau_2$
of $\Pi x:\tau_1.\tau_2$, as usual; the stage variable $\alpha$ is
bound in $M$ of $\Lambda \alpha.M$ and $\tau$ of $\F\alpha.\tau$.
We write $\FV(M)$ and $\FTV(M)$ for the set of free variables and the set of free stage variables in $M$, respectively.  Similarly, $\FV(\tau)$, $\FTV(\tau)$,
$\FV(K)$, and $\FTV(K)$ are defined.
We sometimes abbreviate $\Pi x:\tau_1.\tau_2$ to $\tau_1 \rightarrow \tau_2$ if
$x$ is not a free variable in $\tau_2$.
% Free variables
We identify $\alpha$-convertible terms and assume the names of bound variables are pairwise distinct.
% \AI{This should be mentioned after free variables are introduced.}
% \AI{What about other binders such as $\Pi$?}

The prefix operators $\TW_\alpha, \TB_\alpha, \TBL_\alpha$, and
$\%_\alpha$ connect tighter than the three forms $\tau\ M$, $M\ N$,
$M\ A$ of applications, which are left-associative; The binders $\Pi$,
$\forall$, and $\lambda$ extend as far to the right as possible.
Thus, $\F\alpha.\TW_{\alpha} (\Pi x:\I.\text{Vector}\ 5)$ is
interpreted as
$\F\alpha.(\TW_{\alpha} (\Pi x:\I.(\text{Vector}\ 5)))$; and
$\Lambda\alpha.\lambda x:\I.\TB_\alpha x\ y$ means
$\Lambda\alpha.(\lambda x:\I.(\TB_\alpha x)\ y)$.

\paragraph{Remark:} Basically, we define \LMD to be an extension of
\LTP with dependent types.  One notable difference is that \LMD has
only one kind of \(\alpha\)-closed types, whereas \LTP has two kinds
of \(\alpha\)-closed types \(\forall\alpha.\tau\) and
\(\forall^\varepsilon\alpha.\tau\).  We have omitted the first kind,
for simplicity, and dropped the superscript $\varepsilon$.  It would
not be difficult to recover the distinction to show properties related
to program residualization~\cite{Hanada2014}.


\subsection{Reduction}

Next, we define full reduction for \LMD.
Before giving the definition of reduction, we define six kinds of substitutions.
Substitution $M[x\mapsto N], \tau[x \mapsto N]$ and $K[x \mapsto N]$ are
ordinary capture-avoiding substitution of
term $N$ for $x$ in term $M$, type $\tau$, and kind $K$, respectively,
and we omit their definitions here.
Substitution $M[\alpha \mapsto A], \tau [\alpha \mapsto A], K[\alpha \mapsto A]$ and $B[\alpha\mapsto A]$ are
substitutions of stage $A$ for stage variable $\alpha$ in
term $N$ for $x$ in term $M$, type $\tau$, kind $K$, and stage $B$, respectively.
We show representative cases below.
%
\begin{align*}
    (\lambda x:\tau.M)[\alpha \mapsto A] & = \lambda x:(\tau[\alpha \mapsto A]).(M[\alpha \mapsto A])                                  \\
    (M\ B)[\alpha \mapsto A]             & = (M[\alpha \mapsto A])\ B[\alpha\mapsto A]                                                 \\
    (\TB_\beta M)[\alpha \mapsto A]      & = \TB_{\beta[\alpha \mapsto A]}M[\alpha \mapsto A]                                          \\
    (\TBL_\beta M)[\alpha \mapsto A]     & = \TBL_{\beta[\alpha \mapsto A]}M[\alpha \mapsto A]                                         \\
    (\%_\beta M)[\alpha \mapsto A]       & = \%_{\beta[\alpha \mapsto A]}M[\alpha \mapsto A]                                           \\
    (\beta B)[\alpha \mapsto A]          & = \beta (B[\alpha\mapsto A])                               & (\text{if } \alpha \neq \beta) \\
    (\beta B)[\alpha \mapsto A]          & = A (B[\alpha\mapsto A])                                   & (\text{if } \alpha = \beta)
\end{align*}
Here, $\TB_{\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_n} M$,
$\TBL_{\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_n} M$, and $\%_{\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_n} M$
$(n \geq 0)$ stand for $\TB_{\alpha_1} \cdots \TB_{\alpha_n} M$,
$\TBL_{\alpha_1}\cdots \TBL_{\alpha_n} M$, and
$\%_{\alpha_1}\cdots \%_{\alpha_n} M$, respectively.  In particular,
$\TB_{\varepsilon} M = \TBL_{\varepsilon} M = \%_{\varepsilon} M = M$.

\begin{definition}[Reduction]
    The relations $M \longrightarrow_\beta N$, $M \longrightarrow_\blacklozenge N$, and $M \longrightarrow_\Lambda N$
    are the least compatible relations closed under the rules below.
%    Congruence rules are omitted from the definition.
    \begin{align*}
         (\lambda x:\tau.M) N & \longrightarrow_\beta M[x \mapsto N]         \\
         \TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha M & \longrightarrow_\blacklozenge M          \\
         (\Lambda \alpha.M)\ A & \longrightarrow_\Lambda M[\alpha \mapsto A]
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}
We write $ M \longrightarrow M'$ iff $ M \longrightarrow_\beta M'$,
$ M \longrightarrow_\blacklozenge M'$, or
$ M \longrightarrow_\Lambda M'$ and we call $\longrightarrow_\beta$,
$\longrightarrow_\blacklozenge$, and $\longrightarrow_\Lambda$
$\beta$-reduction, $\blacklozenge$-reduction, and $\Lambda$-reduction,
respectively.
\AI{Don't we need to define $\longrightarrow^*$?}

The relation $\longrightarrow_\beta$ represents ordinary $\beta$-reduction in the \(\lambda\)-calculus; the relation
$\longrightarrow_\blacklozenge$ represents that quotation $\TB_\alpha M$ is canceled by escape and $M$ is spliced into the code fragment surrounding the escape;
the relation $\longrightarrow_\Lambda$ means that a stage abstraction applied to  stage $A$ reduces to the body of the abstraction
where $A$ is substituted for the stage variable.
There is no reduction rule for CSP as with Hanada and Igarashi \cite{Hanada2014}.
The CSP operator $\%_\alpha$ disappears when $\varepsilon$ is substituted for $\alpha$.
We show an example of a reduction sequence below.
Underlines show the redexes.
\begin{align*}
     & \hspace{10mm} \underline{(\lambda i:\I\to\I.(\Lambda\alpha.\TB_\alpha (\%_\alpha i\ 1 + (\TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha 3))\ \varepsilon))\ (\lambda x:\I.x)} \\
     & \longrightarrow_\blacklozenge (\Lambda\alpha.\TB_\alpha (\%_\alpha (\lambda x:\I.x)\ 1 + (\underline{\TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha 3})))\ \varepsilon        \\
     & \longrightarrow_\beta \underline{(\Lambda\alpha.\TB_\alpha (\%_\alpha (\lambda x:\I.x)\ 1 + 3))\ \varepsilon}                                         \\
     & \longrightarrow_\Lambda \underline{(\lambda x:\I.x)\ 1} + 3                                                                                           \\
     & \longrightarrow_\beta 1 + 3                                                                                                                           \\
     & \longrightarrow^* 4
\end{align*}

% $\TB_\alpha$ and $\TBL_\alpha$ disappears in the same way as $\%_\alpha$.

\subsection{Type System}

In this section, we define the type system of \LMD.
It consists of eight judgment forms for signature well-formedness, type environment well-formedness, kind well-formedness, kinding, typing, term equivalence, type equivalence, and kind equivalence.
We list the judgments forms in Figure~\ref{fig:LMD-six-judgments}.
They are all defined in a mutual recursive manner.  We will discuss
each judgment below.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
      \begin{align*}
            \vdash & \Sigma            & \text{signature well-formedness} \\
            \V & \G                & \text{type environment well-formedness} \\
            \G & \V K \iskind @ A      & \text{kind well-formedness} \\
            \G & \V \tau :: K @ A      & \text{kinding}             \\
            \G & \V M : \tau @ A       & \text{typing}              \\
            \G & \V K \E J @ A         & \text{kind equivalence}    \\
            \G & \V \tau \E \sigma @ A & \text{type equivalence}    \\
            \G & \V M \E N @ A         & \text{term equivalence}
        \end{align*}
        \caption{Eight judgment forms of the type system of \LMD.}
        \label{fig:LMD-six-judgments}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Signature and Type Environment Well-formedness.}
The rules for Well-formed signatures and type environments are
shown below:
%
{\small
\begin{center}
  \infrule{
  }{
    \vdash \emptyset
  }
  \hfil
  \infrule{
    \vdash \Sigma \andalso
    \V K \iskind @ \varepsilon \\
    X\notin\textit{dom}(\Sigma)
  }{
    \vdash \Sigma, X::K
  }
  \hfil
  \infrule{
    \vdash \Sigma \andalso
    \V \tau :: * @ \varepsilon \\
    c\notin\textit{dom}(\Sigma)
  }{
   \vdash \Sigma, c:\tau
 }
 \\[2mm]
  \infrule{
  }{
    \V \emptyset
  }
  \hfil
  \infrule{
    \V \Gamma \andalso
    \Gamma \V \tau :: * @ A \andalso
    x\notin\textit{dom}(\Sigma)
  }{
   \V \Gamma, x:\tau@A
 }
\end{center}
}

To add declarations to a signature, the kind/type of a (type-level)
constant has to be well-formed at stage \(\varepsilon\) so that it is
used at any stage. \AI{We should discuss implicit CSP at the type
  level somewhere.}

In what follows, well-formedness is not explicitly mentioned but
we assume that all signatures and type environments are well-formed.

\subsubsection{Kind Wellformedness and Kinding.}

The rules for kind wellformedness and kiding is straightforward
adaptation from \LLF.  So, we omit them.

\subsubsection{Typing.}

\AI{The second premises of \TConst and \TVar are not needed?}
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \infrule[\TConst]{c:\tau \in \Sigma \andalso \G\V \tau::*@A}{\G \V c:\tau @A} \hfil
        \infrule[\TVar]{x:\tau @A \in \G \andalso \G\V \tau::*@A}{\G \V x:\tau @A} \\[2mm]
        \infrule[\TAbs]{\G\V \sigma::*@A\andalso\G,x:\sigma@A\V M:\tau @A}{\G\V(\lambda (x:\sigma).M):(\Pi (x:\sigma).\tau)@A} \\[2mm]
        \infrule[\TApp]{\G\V M:(\Pi (x:\sigma).\tau)@A \andalso \G\V N:\sigma@A}{\G\V M\ N : \tau[x\mapsto N]@A} \\[2mm]
        \infrule[\TConv]{\G\V M:\tau @A \andalso \G\V \tau\equiv \sigma :: K@A}{\G\V M:\sigma@A} \\[2mm]
        \infrule[\TTB]{\G\V M:\tau @{A\alpha}}{\G\V\TB_{\alpha}M:\TW_{\alpha}\tau @A} \andalso
        \infrule[\TTBL]{\G\V M:\TW_{\alpha}\tau @A}{\G\V\TBL_{\alpha}M:\tau @{A\alpha}} \\[2mm]
        \infrule[\TGen]{\G\V M:\tau @A \andalso \alpha\notin\rm{FTV}(\G)\cup\rm{FTV}(A)}{\G\V\Lambda\alpha.M:\forall\alpha.\tau @A} \\[2mm]
        \infrule[\TIns]{\G\V M:\forall\alpha.\tau @A}{\G\V M\ B:\tau[\alpha \mapsto B]@A} \andalso
        \infrule[\TCsp]{\G\V M:\tau @A}{\G\V \%_\alpha M:\tau @{A\alpha}}
        \caption{Typing Rules.}
        \label{fig:typing-rules}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Typing rules of \LMD are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:typing-rules}.
The rule \TConst{} means that a constant can appear at any stage.
% For example, if we have a signature $\Sigma$ which is
% $\textrm{bool} :: *, \textrm{true}: \textrm{bool}, \textrm{false}:
%     \textrm{bool}$, the derivation tree in
% Figure~\ref{fig:tconst-derivation-tree} is admissible.
The rules \TVar,\TAbs, and \TApp{} are almost the same as those in the simply typed
lambda calculus or \LLF.  Additional conditions are that subterms must be
typed at the same stage (\TAbs{} and \TApp); the type
annotation/declaration on a variable has to be a proper type of kind
$*$ (\TAbs) at the stage where it is declared (\TVar{} and \TAbs).
% \AI{Don't we need signature well formedness?  If $c:\tau \in \Sigma$, then $\tau$ should be a well-formed type under ... what?}
% \AI{... or \(\lambda\)LF?  We are working in a dependently type system...}  

% \begin{figure}
%     \begin{center}
%         \begin{minipage}{0.50\hsize}
%             \infer[\TConst]
%             {\G \V \textrm{true}:\textrm{bool}@\alpha\beta}
%             {\textrm{true}:\textrm{bool} \in \Sigma \andalso
%                 \ID{\G\V\textrm{bool}::*@\alpha\beta} \andalso
%             }
%             \caption{A derivation tree using \TConst}
%             \label{fig:tconst-derivation-tree}
%         \end{minipage}
%     \end{center}
% \end{figure}


% \TConv
\AI{Looks like a paper is written for those who know multi-stage calculi fairly well but don't know dependent type systems.  The reality is the opposite.}
As in standard dependent type systems, \TConv{} allows us to replace
the type of a term with an equivalent one.
In a type system with dependent types, this kind of rule is essential
because \AI{?} two types which have different shapes may be equivalent.
For example, when we use a vector type with its size ($\textrm{Vector}\ n$),
$\textrm{Vector}\ 5$ is equivalent to $\textrm{Vector}\ (4+1)$ obviously although they are not syntactically equivalent.

% Typing rules for a multi-stage calculus
% \AI{This paragraph is not very informative.  We shouldn't just refer readers to previous work.}
The rules \TTB, \TTBL, \TGen, \TIns, and \TCsp{} are rules for a multi-stage calculus.
The rule \TTB{}, which corresponds to brackets \AI{Sounds like the rule corresponds to brackets.  What corresponds to brackets is $\TB$}, means that if term $M$ is of type $\tau$ at stage $A\alpha$,
$\TB_\alpha M$ is of type $\TW_\alpha \tau$ at stage $A$.
The rule \TTBL{}, which corresponds to escape, is the converse of \TTB.
The rule \TGen{} for stage abstraction is straightforward.
The condition $\alpha\notin\rm{FTV}(\G)\cup\rm{FTV}(A)$ ensures that
the scope of $\alpha$ is in $M$.
The rule \TIns{} is for applications of stages to stage abstractions.
\AI{Any comments?}
The rule \TCsp is the rule for CSP, which means that
if term $M$ is of type $\tau$ at stage $A$, $\%_\alpha M$ is of type $\tau$ at stage $A\alpha$.  \AI{This does not explain what this rule means.
  It just gives how the rule is read.}

\subsubsection{Kind, Type and Term Equivalence.}

Since the syntax of kinds, types, and terms is mutually recursive,
corresponding notions of equivalence are also mutually recursive.
They are congruences closed under a few axioms for term equivalence.
So, the rules for kind and type equivalences are not very interesting
except implict CSP is allowed.
We show a few representative rules below.

{\small
\begin{center}
\infrule[\textsc{QK-Csp}]{%
  \G\V K \E J @ A
}{
  \G\V K \E J @ A\alpha
}
\hfil
\infrule[\QTCsp]{
  \G\V \tau \E \sigma :: K@A
}{
  \G\V \tau \E \sigma :: K@{A\alpha}
}
\\[2mm]
\infrule[\QTApp]{%
  \G\V \tau \E \sigma :: (\Pi x:\rho.K)@A \andalso
  \G\V M \E N : \rho @A
}{
  \G\V \tau\ M \E \sigma\ N :: K[x \mapsto M]@A
}
\end{center}
}

% The type equivalence judgment of the form
% $\G \V \tau \E \sigma : K @ A$ means that types $\tau$ and $\sigma$
% are equivalent as types of kind $K$ at stage $A$ under $\G$.
% Figure~\ref{fig:type-equivalence-rules} shows the rules for type
% equivalence.  Type equivalence is basically the least congruence
% closed under term equivalence.  The rules for compatibility (closure
% under type formation) are derived from corresponding typing rules in a
% straightforward manner.  The rules are a little simpler than some
% dependent type systems \AI{such as?}  because there is no abstraction
% at the type level.

% All rules except \QTRefl, \QTSym, \QTTrans, and \QTApp\ are generated naturally from the typing rules.
% \QTRefl, \QTSym, \QTTrans\ exist in order to make the type equivalence relation an equivalence relationship.

% \QPercentの説明
The only rule that deserves elaboration is the last rule \QPercent.
Intuitively, it means that the CSP operator applied to term $M$ can be
removed if $M$ is also well typed at the next stage \(A\alpha\).
For example, constants do not depend on the stage (see \TConst) and
so \(\G\V \%_\alpha c \E c : \tau @ A\alpha\) holds but variables
do depend on stages and so this rule does not apply.

Interestingly, Hanada and Igarashi~\cite{Hanada2014} rejected the idea of
reduction that removes $\%_\alpha$ when they developed \LTP{}, as such
reduction does not match the operational behavior of the CSP operator
in implementation.  However, as an equational system for multi-stage
programs, the rule \QPercent makes sense and, as we argue next,
it is practically significant.

\AI{This paragraph should be polished later.}
\renewcommand{\Vpn}{\text{Vector}\ (\%_\alpha n)}
As we discussed in Section 2, $\text{vadd}$ function, 
which takes the length of vectors and returns a quoted add function for vector of the given size,
has the type of $\Pi n:\I.\F\beta.\TW_\beta(\Vpn\to\Vpn\to\Vpn)$.
When we use this function, we instansiate $\text{vadd}$ with some integer such as 5
and get code of a optimzed $\text{vadd}$ function such as $\text{vadd5}$.
\renewcommand{\Vpn}{\text{Vector}\ (\%_\beta 5)}
Although $\text{vadd5}$ is of type $\F\beta.\TW_\beta(\Vpn\to\Vpn\to\Vpn)$,
a code value of this type is difficult to combine with another code fragment.
For example, if we want to composite $\text{vadd5}$ with reverse fucntion, 
which is of type $\text{rev5}:\F\alpha.\TW_\alpha(\text{Vector}\ 5\to\text{Vector}\ 5)$,
we write a program like following.
\begin{align*}
\Lambda\gamma.\TB_\gamma.\lambda v_1:(\text{Vector}\ 5).\lambda v_2:(\text{Vector}\ 5).\TBL_\gamma 
(\text{rev5}\ \gamma)\ (\TBL_\gamma (\text{vadd5}\ \gamma)\ \TBL_\gamma v_1\ \TBL_\gamma v_2)
\end{align*}
However, this program cannot be typed without \QPercent{}
because the type of $v_1$: $\text{Vector}\ 5$ isn't equivalent with the type of arguments of $\text{vadd5}$: $\text{Vector}\ \%_\gamma 5$.

In order to resolve this problem, we introduce \QPercent{} into \LMD.
\begin{center}
\infrule[\QPercent]{\G\V M:\tau @{A\alpha} \andalso \G\V M:\tau @A}{\G\V\%_\alpha M \E M : \tau @{A\alpha}}
\end{center}
\QPercent\ states that we can erase this $\%_\alpha$ under a condition.
The condition is that a CSPed value equals to the original value when it has the same type in the original stage.
For example, $\V \%_\alpha 5 \E 5 @ \alpha$ because $ \V 5 : \I @ \alpha $ from \TConst\ and  $ \V \%_\alpha 5 : \I @ \alpha$.
In other words, we can remove a $\%_\alpha$ symbol of a value when it doesn't change the type.
Thanks to \QPercent, we can identify $\text{Vector}\ 5$ and $\text{Vector}\ \%_\gamma 5$
and compose code values of functions as we expected.

\subsection{Staged Semantics}

The reduction given above is full reduction and any redexes---even
under quotation---can be reduced in an arbitrary order.
Following previous work~\cite{Hanada2014},
we introduce (small-step, call-by-value) staged semantics,
where only $\beta$-reduction or $\Lambda$-reduction at stage $\varepsilon$ or the outer-most $\blacklozenge$-reduction are allowed,
modeling an implementation.

We start with the definition of values. Since terms under quotations are
not executed, the grammar is indexed by stages.

\begin{definition}[Values]
    The family $V^A$ of sets of values, ranged over by $v^A$,
    is defined by the following grammar.  In the grammar, $A \neq \varepsilon$ is assumed.
    \begin{align*}
        v^\varepsilon \in V^\varepsilon & ::= \lambda x:\tau.M \mid\ \TB_\alpha v^\alpha \mid \Lambda\alpha.v^\varepsilon                                       & \\
        v^A \in V^A                     & ::= x \mid \lambda x:\tau.v^A \mid v^A\ v^A \mid\ \TB_\alpha v^{A\alpha} \mid \Lambda\alpha.v^A \mid v^A\ \varepsilon & \\
                                        & \quad\   \mid\ \TBL_\alpha v^{A'} (\text{if } A = A'\alpha \text{ for some } \alpha, A' \neq \varepsilon)             & \\
                                        & \quad\   \mid\ \%_\alpha v^{A'} (\text{if } A = A'\alpha  \text{ for some } \alpha, A')
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}

Values at $\varepsilon$ stage are a $\lambda$-abstraction, a quoted code,
or a $\Lambda$ abstraction.  The body of a $\lambda$-abstraction can
be any term but the body of $\Lambda$-abstraction has to a value.  It
means that the body of $\Lambda$-abstraction must be evaluated.  The
side condition for $\TBL_\alpha v^{A'}$ means that escapes in a value
can appear only under nested quotations (because an escape under a
single quotation will splice the code value into the surrounding
code).  See Hanada and Igarashi~\cite{Hanada2014} for details.

In order to define staged reduction, we define redex and evaluation contexts.

\begin{definition}[Redex]
    The sets of $\varepsilon$-redexes (ranged over by $R^\varepsilon$) and $\alpha$-redexes (ranged over by $R^\alpha$) are defined by the following grammar.
    \begin{align*}
         & R^\varepsilon ::= (\lambda x:\tau.M)\ v^\varepsilon \mid (\Lambda\alpha.v^\varepsilon)\ \varepsilon \\
         & R^\alpha      ::=\ \TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha M                                                         \\
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Evaluation Context]
  Let $B$ be either \(\varepsilon\) or a transition variable \(\beta\).
  The family of sets $ECtx^A_B$ of evaluation contexts, ranged over by $E^A_B$, is defined by the following grammar (in which $A'$ stands for a non-empty stage).
%  $A$ is assumed to be nonempty (but $B,A'$ can be empty).
    \begin{align*}
         E^\varepsilon_B \in ECtx^\varepsilon_B & ::= \square\ (\text{if\ } B = \varepsilon)
        \mid E^\varepsilon_B\ M \mid v^\varepsilon\ E^\varepsilon_B \mid \TB_\alpha E^\alpha_B
        \mid \Lambda\alpha.E^\varepsilon_B \mid E^\varepsilon_B\ A \\
         E^{A'}_B \in ECtx^{A'}_B  & ::= \square\ (\text{if } A' = B) \mid \lambda x:\tau.E^{A'}_B \mid E^{A'}_B\ M \mid v^{A'}\ E^{A'}_B \\
         & \mid \TB_\alpha E^{A'\alpha}_B \mid \TBL_\alpha E^{A}_B \ (\text{where } A\alpha = A')      \\
         & \mid \Lambda\alpha.E^{A'}_B \mid E^{A'}_B\ A \mid \%_\alpha\ E^{A'}_B \ (\text{where } A\alpha = A')
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}
\AI{some more explanation of the syntax of evaluation contexts.}

The subscripts $A$ and $B$ in $E^A_B$ stand for the stage of the evaluation context and of the hole, respectively.  The grammer represents that staged reduction is left-to-right and call-by-value and terms under \(\Lambda\) is reduced.
A few examples of evaluation context are shown below:
\begin{align*}
     \square\ (\lambda x:\I.x) & \in  ECtx^\varepsilon_\varepsilon            \\
     \Lambda\alpha.\square\ \epsilon & \in ECtx^\varepsilon_\varepsilon       \\
     \TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha \TBL_\alpha \square & \in ECtx^\alpha_\varepsilon
\end{align*}
%
We write $E^A_B[M]$ for the term obtained by filling the hole $\square$ in $E^A_B$ by $M$.

Now we define staged reduction using the redex and evaluation contexts.

\begin{definition}[Staged Reduction]
    The staged reduction relation, written $M \longrightarrow_s M'$, is defined by
    the least relation closed under the rules below.
    \begin{align*}
        E^A_\varepsilon [(\lambda x:\tau.M)\ v^\varepsilon] & \longrightarrow_s E^A_\varepsilon[M[x\mapsto v^\varepsilon]]      \\
        E^A_\varepsilon [(\Lambda\alpha.v^\varepsilon)\ A]  & \longrightarrow_s E^A_\varepsilon[v^\varepsilon[\alpha\mapsto A]] \\
        E^A_\alpha [\TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha v^\alpha]        & \longrightarrow_s E^A_\alpha[v^\alpha]                            \\
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}

This reduction relation represents a term reduces in a deterministic,
left-to-right, call-by-value manner.  An application of an abstraction
is executed only at stage \(\varepsilon\) and only a quotation at
stage \(\varepsilon\) is spiliced into the surrounding code---notice
that, if \(\TB_\alpha v^\alpha\) is at stage \(\varepsilon\), then the
redex \(\TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha v^\alpha\) is at stage \(\alpha\).
In other words, terms in brackets are not evaluated until the terms are run
and arguments of a function are evaluated before the application.
We show an example of staged reduction.
Underlines show the redexes.
\begin{align*}
     & (\Lambda\alpha.(\TB_\alpha \underline{\TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha ((\lambda x:\I.x)\ 10))})\ \varepsilon \\
      \longrightarrow_s & \underline{(\Lambda\alpha.(\TB_\alpha ((\lambda x:\I.x)\ 10)))\ \varepsilon}                   \\
      \longrightarrow_s & \underline{(\lambda x:\I.x)\ 10}                                                           \\
      \longrightarrow_s & 10
\end{align*}
