\begin{abstract}
We develop yet another typed multi-stage calculus $\lambda^{\textrm{MD}}$.
It extends Hanada and Igarashi's $\lambda^{\triangleright\%}$ with dependent type.

Dependent types is types dependent on values. 
Vectors with lengths is famous example of dependent types and they enable us to omit boundary checking.

A multi-stage calculus enables us to generate and execute codes at runtime.
It can improve the performance of programs by generating optimized codes for given inputs.

In this paper, we design $\lambda^{\textrm{MD}}$ by introducing dependent type into $\lambda^{\TW\%}$.
You can make more efficient programs from existing dependent typed programs with $\lambda^{\textrm{MD}}$.

It has a simple, substitution-based full-reduction semantics and enjoys basic properties of subject reduction, confluence, strong normalization and progress.

The main technical points of this paper is how to deal with Cross Stage Persistence of multi-stage calculuses in a dependent type system.
CSP is a function of a multi-stage calculus which allows to use a value in quoted code.

The first point is CSP in kinding rules.
$\lambda^{\TW\%}$ contains kinding rules because dependent types need them.

The second point is CSP in equivalence rules.

The abstract should briefly summarize the contents of the paper in 150--250 words.

\section{First Section}
\subsection{A Subsection Sample}
Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate
line.
\begin{equation}
x + y = z
\end{equation}
Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
Fig.~\ref{fig1}).

\begin{figure}

\caption{A figure caption is always placed below the illustration.
Please note that short captions are centered, while long ones are
justified by the macro package automatically.} \label{fig1}
\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}
%
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.
